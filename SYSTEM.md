Here's an outline to get you started:

**System Architecture:**

1. **Front-End:** Develop a user-friendly web and mobile interface for account access, transactions, payments, and more.

2. **Back-End:** Create a backend system responsible for handling user data, transactions, accounts, and interactions with the blockchain.

3. **Blockchain Layer:** Integrate blockchain technology (e.g., Tezos) for security, transparency, and smart contract execution.

**Key Components:**

1. **User Authentication and Identity:**
   - Implement secure user authentication mechanisms.
   - Explore blockchain-based identity solutions to enhance security.

2. **Account Management:**
   - Allow users to create accounts and manage their profile information.
   - Store user data securely, potentially using decentralized identity solutions.

3. **Payments and Transactions:**
   - Facilitate peer-to-peer and cross-border payments using blockchain's speed and efficiency.
   - Implement a secure and fast transaction processing system.

4. **Lending and Borrowing:**
   - Develop a lending mechanism where users can request loans and provide collateral.
   - Utilize smart contracts to automate loan terms and collateral management.

5. **Investment Opportunities:**
   - Integrate with security token platforms to offer investment options.
   - Provide users with access to tokenized assets while ensuring compliance with regulations.

6. **User Portfolio and Analytics:**
   - Offer users a clear overview of their accounts, transactions, loans, and investments.
   - Provide analytics and insights for better financial decision-making.

7. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
   - Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and data privacy laws.

8. **Smart Contracts:**
   - Develop smart contracts for various use cases, such as loan agreements, payment settlements, and investments.

**Technologies:**

1. **Blockchain:**
   - Utilize the chosen blockchain platform (e.g., Tezos) for secure transactions, smart contracts, and data integrity.

2. **Front-End Development:**
   - Choose suitable web and mobile development frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for building user interfaces.

3. **Back-End Development:**
   - Consider using robust back-end technologies (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java) for handling user data and interactions.

4. **Database:**
   - Choose a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data securely.

5. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement encryption, hashing, and other security measures to protect user data and transactions.

6. **Integration APIs:**
   - Integrate with payment gateways, external investment platforms, and other third-party services.

7. **Cloud Services:**
   - Consider using cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability and reliability.

**Scalability:**

As your platform grows, ensure that the architecture can handle increased user traffic and data volume. Consider using load balancing, microservices, and other scalability strategies.
